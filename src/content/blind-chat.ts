## 🛠️ Customizing for Your College

The platform uses a configuration file to define college-specific details. Here's how you can update it:

\`\`\`javascript
/** Example
 * @email : 2023btcse002@curaj.ac.in
 * -->
 * @localPart : 2023btcse002
 * @separator : @ 
 * @domainName : curaj.ac.in
*/

export const studentEmailConfig = {
  college: {
    name: 'Your College Name',
    shortHand: 'Short Name',
    },
    localPart: {
      example: "2023BTCSE017", // enrollment ID
      regex: /^\d{4}[A-Za-z]+\d{3}$/,  // Regex for enrollment ID
      },
      domainName: 'yourcollege.ac.in',
      support_email: 'support@yourcollege.ac.in'
      }
\`\`\`
      
  1. Update the \`college\` and \`domainName\` fields to match your college.
  2. Customize the regex for student email IDs if needed.
  3. Save the file and restart the application.
